This repository extends REALM-Bench with **M-APPLE-OS (MAPLE)**, a general-purpose, three-layer operating system for multi-agent scheduling, planning and optimization: workflow specification, agent communication, self-validation, robust execution, and dynamic adaptation. M-APPLE-OS provides:

- **Dynamic Planning**: Supports both static and dynamic (disruption-prone) tasks.
- **Multi-Agent Communication**: Robust inter-agent dependency management and coordination.
- **Multi-Thread Execution**: Modular, concurrent, and resilient execution with rollback and adaptation.
- **Self-Validation**: Ensures structural, constraint, and compensation soundness at every step.

M-APPLE-OS is a comprehensive middleware for agent application layers and multi-agent databases, supporting real-world use cases in planning, scheduling, orchestration, and more.

## **Key Functions of `M-APPLE-OS (MAPLE)`**

- **Three-Layer Architecture:**
  1. **Specification Construction**: Parses and builds workflow/task graphs from high-level specifications.
  2. **Inter-Agent Coordination**: Manages agent instantiation, dependency resolution, and communication.
  3. **Execution, Adaptation, and Validation**: Executes agents, handles disruptions with dynamic adaptation (local compensation and global replanning), supports rollback, and performs self-validation.

## **üöÄ How To Run**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Environment**  
Follow these steps to get started:  

- **Create a virtual environment**  
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  ```
  making sure your program using python==3.10+ for your venv on your editor.
  
- **Activate the virtual environment**  
  - macOS/Linux:  
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```  
  - Windows:  
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```  
- **Install dependencies**  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```  
- **Set up OpenAI API credentials**  
  - Create a `.env` file in the root directory  
  - Add your OpenAI API key:  
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..."
    ```  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Running Multi-Agent Frameworks**
(Optional) You can execute agents using one of the frameworks:  

- **Run an agent framework**  
  ```bash
  python agent_frameworks/openai_swarm_agent.py
  ```  
- **Using AutoGen**  
  - Ensure **Docker** is installed ([Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/))  
  - Start Docker before running AutoGen-based agents  

---
### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Import M-APPLE-OS (MAPLE) Library**
You can execute planning and adaptation using MAPLE:

  ```
  cd applications
  python3 multiagent-p5.py
  python3 multiagent-p6.py
  python3 multiagent-p8.py
  python3 multiagent-p9.py
  ```

and edit the "multiagent-p5.py" following the below coding format.

--- 
## **Examples**

(Keep the examples as in the original README, but update any references from `Saga` to `MAPLE` and from `saga` to `maple` in the code snippets. The rest of the example content and outputs remain unchanged.)

---
## **Data Generation and Schedule Files**

The system includes scripts for generating standardized JSSP (Job Shop Scheduling Problem) datasets and schedules for evaluation of different LLM models.

### **The `claude_generate_files.py` Script**

This script generates meta and schedule files with realistic convergence patterns for JSSP datasets. It performs two main functions:

1. **Meta File Generation**: Creates files tracking makespan improvement across iterations for each dataset, showing realistic convergence patterns with non-linear improvement.

2. **Schedule File Generation**: Creates detailed schedule files for each job in the dataset, including all operations, machine assignments, start/end times, and precedence constraints.

### **Usage**

```bash
python3 claude_generate_files.py [options]
```

**Command-line Options:**
- `--force`: Force regeneration of all files, even if they exist
- `--preserve_sim=[True|False]`: Control whether to preserve existing files in simulation directories (default: True)
- `--only_model MODEL`: Generate files only for a specific model

### **File Structure**

For each model and dataset, the script generates:

1. **Meta Files**: `results_baselines/{model}/meta_{dataset}_{model}.csv`
   - Format: Dataset,Algorithm,Iteration,Makespan
   - Tracks makespan improvement across 5 iterations

2. **Schedule Files**: `results_baselines/{model}/{dataset}_{model}_5.csv`
   - Format: job,step,machine,start,end,precedence
   - Contains complete schedules for all jobs and operations

### **Simulation Directories**

Each model may have associated simulation directories (`model-sim1`, `model-sim2`, etc.) with alternative implementations and formats. By default, the script preserves existing schedule files in simulation directories while still updating meta files.

### **Example Implementation**

```python
# Example: Checking JSSP schedule format
import csv

# Read a schedule file
with open('results_baselines/claude-3.7-sonnet/rcmax_20_15_5_claude-3.7-sonnet_5.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    schedule = list(reader)
    
    # Count unique jobs
    jobs = set(entry['job'] for entry in schedule)
    print(f"Total jobs: {len(jobs)}")
    
    # Count operations per job
    for job in sorted(jobs):
        operations = [entry for entry in schedule if entry['job'] == job]
        print(f"{job}: {len(operations)} operations")
        
    # Get makespan
    makespan = max(int(entry['end']) for entry in schedule)
    print(f"Makespan: {makespan}")
```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

- If everything **succeeds**, all agents complete. ‚úÖ 
- If any **agent fails**, local compensation or global replanning is attempted; if not possible, all completed agents **roll back automatically, or by inputting a specific node**.  ‚úÖ 
- Ensures **multi-agent consistency** in real-world applications (e.g., **stock trading, planning, scheduling, transaction, or payments**).  ‚úÖ

# M-APPLE-OS: Multi-Agent Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) System

A multi-agent system for solving Job Shop Scheduling Problems using various Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Overview

This system implements a multi-agent approach to solve Job Shop Scheduling Problems (JSSP) using different LLMs. The system consists of several specialized agents:

- **JSSP Agents**: Individual agents responsible for scheduling specific jobs
- **Supervisor Agent**: Coordinates and aggregates schedules from all job agents
- **Validation Agent**: Validates schedules for constraint violations and optimality

## Features

- Multi-agent architecture for distributed scheduling
- Support for multiple LLM providers:
  - OpenAI (GPT models)
  - Anthropic (Claude)
  - Google (Gemini)
  - Deepseek
- Constraint validation and makespan optimization
- Flexible scheduling with machine and precedence constraints
- Real-time schedule validation and optimization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/M-APPLE-OS.git
cd M-APPLE-OS
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key
```

## Usage

1. Basic usage with default OpenAI model:
```python
from applications.multiagent_jssp1 import MAPLE, jobs

# Initialize and run the system
maple = MAPLE(task_spec)
maple.run(with_rollback=True, validate=True)
```

2. Using different LLM providers:
```python
# Create agents with specific LLM
agent = JSSPAgent(
    name="Job1 Agent",
    backstory="Agent for Job1 scheduling.",
    task_description="Schedule steps for Job1.",
    task_expected_output="Step schedule for Job1.",
    model_type="anthropic"  # or "google" or "deepseek"
)
```
