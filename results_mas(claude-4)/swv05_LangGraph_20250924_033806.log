üîß Job Scheduler Agent: Creating initial job schedules
üîç DEBUG: Job Scheduler full response: Let me solve this JSSP problem step by step using a systematic approach. I'll use the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) dispatching rule as a starting heuristic and then provide the detailed schedule.

**Job Scheduler Analysis: JSSP swv05 Solution**

I'll solve this using a priority-based scheduling approach, considering both job precedence constraints and machine availability.

**Algorithm Applied:**
1. Use Shortest Processing Time (SPT) rule for initial scheduling
2. Maintain machine availability tracking
3. Ensure job precedence constraints are satisfied
4. Calculate start/end times for each operation

## Machine Coordinator Analysis: Conflict Resolution and Optimization

### Critical Bottleneck Identification:
- **Machine7**: 1,235 time units (highest load) - Critical bottleneck
- **Machine3**: 1,230 time units - Secondary bottleneck  
- **Machine8**: 1,189 time units - High utilization
- **Machine5**: 1,158 time units - High utilization

### Conflict Resolution Strategies:

1. **Bottleneck-First Scheduling**: Prioritize scheduling operations on Machine7 and Machine3 to minimize idle time on critical resources.

2. **Load Balancing**: Distribute workload across machines while respecting job precedence constraints.

3. **Critical Path Optimization**: Focus on jobs with longest processing paths through bottleneck machines.

4. **Conflict Resolution Protocol**: When multiple jobs compete for the same machine, apply earliest-due-date and shortest-processing-time rules.

Job Scheduler Agent: Let me solve this JSSP problem step by step using a systematic approach. I'll use the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) dispatching rule as a starting heuristic and then provide the detailed schedule.

**Job Scheduler Analysis: JSSP swv05 Solution**

I'll solve this using a priority-based scheduling approach, considering both job precedence constraints and machine availability.

**Algorithm Applied:**
1. Use Shortest Processing Time (SPT) rule for initial scheduling
2. Maintain machine availability tracking
3. Ensure job precedence constraints are satisfied
4. Calculate start/end times for each operation

Machine Coordinator Agent: Based on my analysis, let me provide a comprehensive Machine Coordinator Analysis with conflict resolution strategies and an optimized schedule:

## Machine Coordinator Analysis: Conflict Resolution and Optimization

### Critical Bottleneck Identification:
- **Machine7**: 1,235 time units (highest load) - Critical bottleneck
- **Machine3**: 1,230 time units - Secondary bottleneck  
- **Machine8**: 1,189 time units - High utilization
- **Machine5**: 1,158 time units - High utilization

### Conflict Resolution Strategies:

1. **Bottleneck-First Scheduling**: Prioritize scheduling operations on Machine7 and Machine3 to minimize idle time on critical resources.

2. **Load Balancing**: Distribute workload across machines while respecting job precedence constraints.

3. **Critical Path Optimization**: Focus on jobs with longest processing paths through bottleneck machines.

4. **Conflict Resolution Protocol**: When multiple jobs compete for the same machine, apply earliest-due-date and shortest-processing-time rules.

Machine Coordinator Agent: Based on my analysis, let me provide a comprehensive Machine Coordinator Analysis with conflict resolution strategies and an optimized schedule:

## Machine Coordinator Analysis: Conflict Resolution and Optimization

### Critical Bottleneck Identification:
- **Machine7**: 1,235 time units (highest load) - Critical bottleneck
- **Machine3**: 1,230 time units - Secondary bottleneck  
- **Machine8**: 1,189 time units - High utilization
- **Machine5**: 1,158 time units - High utilization

### Conflict Resolution Strategies:

1. **Bottleneck-First Scheduling**: Prioritize scheduling operations on Machine7 and Machine3 to minimize idle time on critical resources.

2. **Load Balancing**: Distribute workload across machines while respecting job precedence constraints.

3. **Critical Path Optimization**: Focus on jobs with longest processing paths through bottleneck machines.

4. **Conflict Resolution Protocol**: When multiple jobs compete for the same machine, apply earliest-due-date and shortest-processing-time rules.

### Optimized Schedule Solution:
