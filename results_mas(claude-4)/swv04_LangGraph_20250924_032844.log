📋 Problem: Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP)
🔧 Job Scheduler Agent: Creating initial job schedules
🔍 DEBUG: Job Scheduler full response: Let me solve this JSSP problem step by step using a priority dispatching rule approach.

**Job Scheduler Analysis: JSSP swv04 Solution**

I'll use the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) dispatching rule combined with machine availability tracking to create an initial feasible schedule.

**Algorithm Applied:**
1. Initialize all machines as available at time 0
2. For each job, schedule operations in sequence
3. For each operation, start at max(job_ready_time, machine_available_time)
4. Update machine availability after each operation

**Detailed Schedule Calculation:**

⚙️ Machine Coordinator Agent: Resolving machine conflicts
🔍 DEBUG: Machine Coordinator full response: Now let me solve the JSSP problem using a systematic approach to minimize makespan and resolve conflicts:

**Machine Coordinator Analysis: [conflict resolution and optimization]**

Based on my analysis of the swv04 JSSP dataset, I've identified several key conflict areas and optimization strategies:

## Conflict Identification:
1. **Machine Utilization Imbalance**: Machine2 shows high processing times (10-100 units), creating potential bottlenecks
2. **Sequential Dependencies**: Each job's 10 operations must be processed in strict sequence, creating cascading delays
3. **Resource Contention**: All 10 machines must handle exactly 20 operations each, leading to scheduling conflicts

## Optimization Strategy:
Using a hybrid approach combining Critical Path Method (CPM) and machine load balancing, I'll implement a schedule that minimizes idle time and resolves conflicts through:
- Early start scheduling for critical operations
- Load balancing across machines
- Conflict resolution through time-shifted scheduling

👑 Supervisor Agent: Coordinating final solution
🔍 DEBUG: Supervisor full response: Now let me implement a scheduling solution using the provided job specifications. I'll use a list scheduling algorithm with priority rules to generate an optimal schedule.

Based on the job specifications provided, I'll solve this step by step:

**Supervisor Final Coordination:**

After analyzing the JSSP swv04 problem with 20 jobs and 10 machines, I'll implement a priority-based scheduling algorithm considering:

1. **Job precedence constraints**: Each job's operations must be completed in sequence
2. **Machine constraints**: No two operations can use the same machine simultaneously
3. **Makespan minimization**: Optimize the total completion time

Job Scheduler Agent: Let me solve this JSSP problem step by step using a priority dispatching rule approach.

**Job Scheduler Analysis: JSSP swv04 Solution**

I'll use the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) dispatching rule combined with machine availability tracking to create an initial feasible schedule.

**Algorithm Applied:**
1. Initialize all machines as available at time 0
2. For each job, schedule operations in sequence
3. For each operation, start at max(job_ready_time, machine_available_time)
4. Update machine availability after each operation

**Detailed Schedule Calculation:**

Machine Coordinator Agent: Now let me solve the JSSP problem using a systematic approach to minimize makespan and resolve conflicts:

**Machine Coordinator Analysis: [conflict resolution and optimization]**

Based on my analysis of the swv04 JSSP dataset, I've identified several key conflict areas and optimization strategies:

## Conflict Identification:
1. **Machine Utilization Imbalance**: Machine2 shows high processing times (10-100 units), creating potential bottlenecks
2. **Sequential Dependencies**: Each job's 10 operations must be processed in strict sequence, creating cascading delays
3. **Resource Contention**: All 10 machines must handle exactly 20 operations each, leading to scheduling conflicts

## Optimization Strategy:
Using a hybrid approach combining Critical Path Method (CPM) and machine load balancing, I'll implement a schedule that minimizes idle time and resolves conflicts through:
- Early start scheduling for critical operations
- Load balancing across machines
- Conflict resolution through time-shifted scheduling

Supervisor Agent: Now let me implement a scheduling solution using the provided job specifications. I'll use a list scheduling algorithm with priority rules to generate an optimal schedule.

Based on the job specifications provided, I'll solve this step by step:

**Supervisor Final Coordination:**

After analyzing the JSSP swv04 problem with 20 jobs and 10 machines, I'll implement a priority-based scheduling algorithm considering:

1. **Job precedence constraints**: Each job's operations must be completed in sequence
2. **Machine constraints**: No two operations can use the same machine simultaneously
3. **Makespan minimization**: Optimize the total completion time

Let me calculate the schedule using a list scheduling approach with earliest available time priority:

Machine Coordinator Agent: Now let me solve the JSSP problem using a systematic approach to minimize makespan and resolve conflicts:

**Machine Coordinator Analysis: [conflict resolution and optimization]**

Based on my analysis of the swv04 JSSP dataset, I've identified several key conflict areas and optimization strategies:

## Conflict Identification:
1. **Machine Utilization Imbalance**: Machine2 shows high processing times (10-100 units), creating potential bottlenecks
2. **Sequential Dependencies**: Each job's 10 operations must be processed in strict sequence, creating cascading delays
3. **Resource Contention**: All 10 machines must handle exactly 20 operations each, leading to scheduling conflicts

## Optimization Strategy:
Using a hybrid approach combining Critical Path Method (CPM) and machine load balancing, I'll implement a schedule that minimizes idle time and resolves conflicts through:
- Early start scheduling for critical operations
- Load balancing across machines
- Conflict resolution through time-shifted scheduling

## SOLUTION:

Supervisor Agent: Now let me implement a scheduling solution using the provided job specifications. I'll use a list scheduling algorithm with priority rules to generate an optimal schedule.

Based on the job specifications provided, I'll solve this step by step:

**Supervisor Final Coordination:**

After analyzing the JSSP swv04 problem with 20 jobs and 10 machines, I'll implement a priority-based scheduling algorithm considering:

1. **Job precedence constraints**: Each job's operations must be completed in sequence
2. **Machine constraints**: No two operations can use the same machine simultaneously
3. **Makespan minimization**: Optimize the total completion time

Let me calculate the schedule using a list scheduling approach with earliest available time priority:
