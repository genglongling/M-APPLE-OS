üîç LangGraph Framework Details:
--------------------------------------------------

üìù Job Scheduler Agent Prompt:
  system_prompt: You are a Job Scheduler Agent using LangGraph workflow. Analyze job requirements and create initial schedules for all jobs.

üí¨ Job Scheduler Agent Output:
  === LANGGRAPH REAL AGENTS ===

Job Scheduler Agent: It seems there was an error while trying to generate the initial schedules using SQL. Let's try a different approach to solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) for the given dataset. I will attempt to create a schedule manually based on the provided job and machine constraints. This process might take a bit of time due to the complexity of the problem. 

Please hold on while I work on this.
Machine Coordinator Agent: The dataset provided is too large to process in a single request due to the token limit. To address this, we can break down the problem into smaller parts or focus on specific aspects of the scheduling problem. Here are a few strategies we can consider:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Break down the dataset into smaller subsets, such as focusing on a few jobs at a time, and analyze them separately.

2. **Focus on Specific Machines**: Analyze the scheduling for specific machines to identify conflicts and optimize their utilization.

3. **Sequential Analysis**: Process the jobs sequentially, analyzing and resolving conflicts for each job before moving to the next.

4. **Simplified Model**: Create a simplified version of the problem with fewer jobs or operations to demonstrate conflict resolution strategies.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, or if you have a specific aspect of the problem you would like to focus on.
Supervisor Agent: The dataset provided is too large to process in a single request due to token limitations. To solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) effectively, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts or use a specialized algorithm or tool designed for such complex scheduling tasks.

Here's a suggested approach to tackle this problem:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Break down the dataset into smaller subsets of jobs and solve each subset individually. This can help manage the complexity and size of the data.

2. **Use Specialized Software**: Consider using specialized software or libraries designed for solving JSSP, such as OR-Tools by Google, which can handle large datasets and complex constraints efficiently.

3. **Iterative Optimization**: Start with a simple heuristic or rule-based schedule and iteratively improve it using optimization techniques like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or tabu search.

4. **Parallel Processing**: If possible, use parallel processing to handle different parts of the problem simultaneously, which can significantly reduce computation time.

If you have access to any of these tools or methods, I recommend using them to solve the JSSP for the given dataset. If you need further assistance with a specific part of the problem, feel free to ask!
