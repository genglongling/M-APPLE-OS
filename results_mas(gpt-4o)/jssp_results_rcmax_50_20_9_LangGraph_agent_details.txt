AGENT PROMPTS AND OUTPUTS DETAILS
==================================================

üîç LangGraph Framework Details:
--------------------------------------------------

üìù Job Scheduler Agent Prompt:
  system_prompt: You are a Job Scheduler Agent using LangGraph workflow. Analyze job requirements and create initial schedules for all jobs.

üí¨ Job Scheduler Agent Output:
  === LANGGRAPH REAL AGENTS ===

Job Scheduler Agent: Agent response (timeout after 120s): You are a Job Scheduler Agent specialized in JSSP problems.
    
        Job Shop Scheduling Problem...
Machine Coordinator Agent: The dataset provided is too large to process in a single request due to the context length limitations. To address this, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts or focus on specific aspects of the scheduling problem. Here are a few strategies we can consider:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Break down the dataset into smaller subsets of jobs and solve each subset individually. This can help in managing the complexity and size of the data.

2. **Focus on Specific Machines**: Analyze the scheduling for specific machines to identify conflicts and optimize their utilization.

3. **Iterative Approach**: Process a few jobs at a time, analyze the results, and then proceed with the next set of jobs.

4. **Simplified Model**: Create a simplified version of the problem with fewer jobs or operations to get a preliminary solution.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, or if you have any specific part of the problem you want to focus on.
Supervisor Agent: Agent response (timeout after 120s): You are a Supervisor Agent specialized in JSSP problems.

üìù Supervisor Agent Prompt:
  system_prompt: You are a Supervisor Agent using LangGraph workflow. Aggregate all job schedules and produce the overall JSSP schedule. Coordinate between all job agents to find the optimal solution.
