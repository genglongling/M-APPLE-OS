üîç LangGraph Framework Details:
--------------------------------------------------

üìù Job Scheduler Agent Prompt:
  system_prompt: You are a Job Scheduler Agent using LangGraph workflow. Analyze job requirements and create initial schedules for all jobs.

üí¨ Job Scheduler Agent Output:
  === LANGGRAPH REAL AGENTS ===

Job Scheduler Agent: Agent response (timeout after 120s): You are a Job Scheduler Agent specialized in JSSP problems.
    
        Job Shop Scheduling Problem...
Machine Coordinator Agent: The dataset provided is too large to process in a single request due to the token limit. To effectively analyze and resolve machine conflicts, we need to break down the dataset into smaller parts or focus on specific aspects of the problem.

Here's a strategy to proceed:

1. **Divide the Dataset**: Break down the dataset into smaller chunks, perhaps by focusing on a subset of jobs or machines at a time.

2. **Identify Key Conflicts**: Focus on identifying conflicts for a specific set of machines or jobs. This can help in understanding the nature of conflicts and how they can be resolved.

3. **Iterative Analysis**: Analyze each subset iteratively to identify conflicts and propose solutions.

4. **Optimization Strategies**: Once conflicts are identified, propose strategies such as re-sequencing operations, adjusting start times, or redistributing workloads across machines.

If you have a specific subset of jobs or machines you'd like to focus on, please let me know, and we can proceed with a more targeted analysis.
Supervisor Agent: The dataset provided is too large to process in a single request due to the token limit. To solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) for this dataset, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts or use a specialized tool or algorithm designed for JSSP.

Here are some steps you can take to solve this problem:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Break down the dataset into smaller subsets of jobs and solve each subset individually. Then, combine the solutions while resolving any conflicts.

2. **Use a JSSP Solver**: Utilize a specialized JSSP solver or optimization software that can handle large datasets. These tools often use algorithms like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or constraint programming to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.

3. **Iterative Improvement**: Start with an initial feasible schedule and iteratively improve it by swapping operations, adjusting start times, or using local search techniques.

4. **Parallel Processing**: If possible, use parallel processing to handle multiple parts of the problem simultaneously, which can speed up the computation.

If you have access to any specific tools or software for JSSP, I recommend using them to handle this complex problem. If you need further assistance with a specific part of the problem, feel free to ask!
