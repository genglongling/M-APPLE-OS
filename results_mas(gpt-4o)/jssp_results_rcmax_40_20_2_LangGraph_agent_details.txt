üîç LangGraph Framework Details:
--------------------------------------------------

üìù Job Scheduler Agent Prompt:
  system_prompt: You are a Job Scheduler Agent using LangGraph workflow. Analyze job requirements and create initial schedules for all jobs.

üí¨ Job Scheduler Agent Output:
  === LANGGRAPH REAL AGENTS ===

Job Scheduler Agent: Agent response (timeout after 120s): You are a Job Scheduler Agent specialized in JSSP problems.
    
        Job Shop Scheduling Problem...
Machine Coordinator Agent: The dataset provided is too large to process in a single request due to token limitations. To address this, we can break down the problem into smaller parts or focus on specific aspects of the scheduling problem. Here are a few strategies we can consider:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Break down the dataset into smaller subsets, such as focusing on a few jobs at a time, and analyze them separately.

2. **Focus on Specific Machines**: Analyze the scheduling for specific machines to identify conflicts and optimize their utilization.

3. **Sequential Analysis**: Process the data in a sequence, analyzing a portion of the jobs, and then iteratively building on the results.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, or if you have a specific aspect of the problem you would like to focus on.
Supervisor Agent: The dataset provided is too large to process in a single request due to token limitations. To solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) effectively, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts or use a specialized algorithm or software designed for such complex scheduling tasks.

Here are some steps you can take to solve this problem:

1. **Use a JSSP Solver**: Consider using specialized software or libraries designed for solving JSSP, such as Google's OR-Tools, which can handle large datasets and complex constraints.

2. **Divide and Conquer**: Break down the dataset into smaller, manageable parts, solve each part separately, and then integrate the solutions.

3. **Heuristic Methods**: Implement heuristic or metaheuristic algorithms like Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, or Tabu Search, which are often used for solving JSSP.

4. **Consult Experts**: If you have access to operations research experts or industrial engineers, they can provide insights and potentially custom solutions for your specific problem.

If you have access to any of these tools or methods, I recommend using them to find an optimal or near-optimal solution for your scheduling problem.
