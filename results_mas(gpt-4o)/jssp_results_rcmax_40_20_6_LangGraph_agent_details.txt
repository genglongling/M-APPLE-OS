üîç LangGraph Framework Details:
--------------------------------------------------

üìù Job Scheduler Agent Prompt:
  system_prompt: You are a Job Scheduler Agent using LangGraph workflow. Analyze job requirements and create initial schedules for all jobs.

üí¨ Job Scheduler Agent Output:
  === LANGGRAPH REAL AGENTS ===

Job Scheduler Agent: Agent response (timeout after 120s): You are a Job Scheduler Agent specialized in JSSP problems.
    
        Job Shop Scheduling Problem...
Machine Coordinator Agent: The dataset provided is too large to process in a single request due to the token limit. To address this, we can break down the problem into smaller parts or focus on specific aspects of the scheduling problem. Here are a few strategies we can consider:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Break down the dataset into smaller subsets, such as focusing on a few jobs at a time, and analyze them separately.

2. **Focus on Specific Machines**: Analyze the scheduling for specific machines to identify conflicts and optimize their utilization.

3. **Sequential Analysis**: Process the jobs sequentially, analyzing and resolving conflicts for each job one at a time.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, or if you have a specific aspect of the problem you would like to focus on.
Supervisor Agent: The dataset provided is too large to process in a single request due to token limitations. To solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) for this dataset, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts or use a specialized tool or algorithm designed for JSSP.

Here are some steps you can take to solve this problem:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Break down the dataset into smaller subsets of jobs and solve each subset individually. Then, combine the solutions while resolving any conflicts.

2. **Use a JSSP Solver**: Utilize a specialized JSSP solver or software that can handle large datasets. These solvers use algorithms like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or constraint programming to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.

3. **Optimize Sequentially**: Start by scheduling a few jobs and gradually add more jobs to the schedule, optimizing at each step to minimize the makespan.

4. **Parallel Processing**: If possible, use parallel processing to handle multiple parts of the dataset simultaneously, then integrate the results.

If you have access to any specific tools or software for JSSP, I recommend using them to handle this complex problem. Alternatively, if you can provide a smaller subset of the data, I can assist in solving that portion.
