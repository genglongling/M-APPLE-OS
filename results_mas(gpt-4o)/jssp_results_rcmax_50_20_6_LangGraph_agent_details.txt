AGENT PROMPTS AND OUTPUTS DETAILS
==================================================

üîç LangGraph Framework Details:
--------------------------------------------------

üìù Job Scheduler Agent Prompt:
  system_prompt: You are a Job Scheduler Agent using LangGraph workflow. Analyze job requirements and create initial schedules for all jobs.

üí¨ Job Scheduler Agent Output:
  === LANGGRAPH REAL AGENTS ===

Job Scheduler Agent: Agent response (timeout after 120s): You are a Job Scheduler Agent specialized in JSSP problems.
    
        Job Shop Scheduling Problem...
Machine Coordinator Agent: The dataset provided is too large to process in a single request due to the context length limitations. To address this, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts or focus on specific aspects of the scheduling problem. Here are a few strategies we can consider:

1. **Focus on a Subset of Jobs**: Instead of analyzing all 50 jobs at once, we can start by examining a smaller subset, such as the first 10 jobs, to identify potential conflicts and optimization strategies.

2. **Analyze Specific Machines**: We can focus on specific machines to identify conflicts and optimize their utilization. For example, we can analyze the scheduling of operations on Machine0, Machine1, etc., one at a time.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**: We can break down the analysis into steps, such as first identifying conflicts, then proposing resolutions, and finally optimizing the schedule.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, or if you have a specific focus area in mind.
Supervisor Agent: The dataset provided is too large to process in a single request due to the token limit. To solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) for this dataset, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts or use a specialized tool or algorithm designed for JSSP.

Here's a general approach to solving JSSP:

1. **Model the Problem**: Use a mathematical model or a heuristic approach to represent the problem. Common methods include:
   - Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
   - Constraint Programming (CP)
   - Genetic Algorithms
   - Simulated Annealing

2. **Use a Solver**: Implement or use an existing solver that can handle JSSP. Some popular solvers include:
   - Google OR-Tools
   - IBM ILOG CPLEX
   - Gurobi

3. **Iterative Improvement**: Start with an initial feasible solution and iteratively improve it by exploring the solution space.

4. **Parallel Processing**: If possible, divide the problem into smaller sub-problems and solve them in parallel.

5. **Visualization**: Use Gantt charts or other visualization tools to represent the schedule and identify bottlenecks.

If you have access to any of these tools or methods, I recommend using them to solve the problem. If you need further assistance with a specific part of the problem, feel free to ask!
