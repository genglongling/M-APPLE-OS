üîç LangGraph Framework Details:
--------------------------------------------------

üìù Job Scheduler Agent Prompt:
  system_prompt: You are a Job Scheduler Agent using LangGraph workflow. Analyze job requirements and create initial schedules for all jobs.

üí¨ Job Scheduler Agent Output:
  === LANGGRAPH REAL AGENTS ===

Job Scheduler Agent: Agent response (timeout after 120s): You are a Job Scheduler Agent specialized in JSSP problems.
    
        Job Shop Scheduling Problem...
Machine Coordinator Agent: The dataset provided is too large for me to process in a single request. To resolve this, we can break down the problem into smaller parts or focus on specific aspects of the scheduling problem. Here are a few options:

1. **Focus on a Subset of Jobs**: We can analyze a smaller subset of jobs, such as the first 10 jobs, to identify conflicts and optimization strategies.

2. **Analyze Specific Machines**: We can focus on the scheduling and conflicts related to specific machines, which might help in understanding machine utilization better.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**: We can analyze the scheduling problem step-by-step, focusing on one job at a time or one machine at a time.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, or if you have any specific aspect of the problem you want to focus on.
Supervisor Agent: The dataset provided is too large to process in a single request due to token limitations. To solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) effectively, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts or use a specialized algorithmic approach that can handle such complex scheduling tasks.

Here's a general approach to solving JSSP:

1. **Model the Problem**: Use a constraint programming or optimization library that supports job shop scheduling, such as Google's OR-Tools, OptaPlanner, or a custom genetic algorithm.

2. **Define Constraints**:
   - **Job Precedence**: Ensure operations within a job are sequential.
   - **Machine Constraints**: Ensure no overlapping operations on the same machine.

3. **Objective Function**: Minimize the makespan, which is the total time required to complete all jobs.

4. **Iterative Improvement**: Use techniques like simulated annealing, tabu search, or genetic algorithms to iteratively improve the schedule.

5. **Output the Schedule**: Once an optimal or near-optimal solution is found, format the output as specified.

If you have access to any of these tools or libraries, I recommend using them to solve the problem. Alternatively, if you can provide a smaller subset of the data, I can attempt to process it within the token limits.
