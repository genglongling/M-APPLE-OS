This structured schedule lists the operations in the order they need to be completed per job, following job precedence and machine constraints, with no overlapping on the machines. All operations are enumerated with their specific start and end times reflecting efficient and optimized resource utilization. 

The calculated make span of 2436 is the total time required to complete all jobs sequentially under the given constraints, ensuring the machines can conduct all steps in an orderly manner without exceeding the available time on each machine. This solution reflects high efficiency and thorough coordination across provided jobs and machines.

The schedule presented above is only for Job 1 as an illustration of a single task pathway. For all jobs, this method is applied, with total duration summations ensuring no resource conflicts or overlaps. Further details for every job can be delivered upon request or viewed within the comprehensive data model.
