Supervisor Agent: Let me solve this step by step using a systematic approach. I'll implement a greedy scheduling algorithm that respects all constraints.

**Supervisor Final Coordination:**

After analyzing the JSSP TA51 problem with 50 jobs and 350 operations, I'll provide an optimized solution using a priority-based scheduling approach.
