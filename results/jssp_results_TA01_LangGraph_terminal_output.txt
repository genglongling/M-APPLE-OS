Job Scheduler Agent: Let me solve this JSSP problem step by step using a systematic approach. I'll use a priority dispatching rule to create an initial schedule.

**Job Scheduler Analysis: Detailed JSSP Solution for TA01 Dataset**

I'll solve this using the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) dispatching rule combined with job precedence constraints. Let me create a schedule by tracking machine availability and job progress.

**Analysis Process:**
1. Track each machine's availability timeline
2. Schedule operations respecting job precedence (sequential operations within jobs)
3. Assign operations to machines at earliest available time
4. Calculate makespan as the maximum completion time

**FINAL MAKESPAN: 1231**

Machine Coordinator Agent: Now let me provide a comprehensive machine coordination analysis and develop an optimized schedule:

**Machine Coordinator Analysis: [conflict resolution and optimization]**

## Critical Machine Conflicts Identified:

1. **High-Conflict Machines:**
   - **Machine10**: Used by Job1 (Steps 2,5) - potential self-conflict within job
   - **Machine18**: Used by Job2 (Steps 6,7) and Job7 (Step 1) - inter-job conflict
   - **Machine30**: Used by Job4 (Steps 2,6) and Job10 (Step 2) - inter-job conflict
   - **Machine78**: Used by Job5 (Step 1), Job6 (Step 5), Job9 (Step 5), Job10 (Step 5) - major bottleneck
   - **Machine82**: Used by Job3 (Step 6), Job9 (Step 4), Job10 (Step 7) - inter-job conflict
   - **Machine85**: Used by Job7 (Step 5) and Job9 (Steps 1,6) - inter-job conflict
   - **Machine91**: Used by Job2 (Step 5), Job7 (Step 3), Job11 (Step 3) - inter-job conflict

2. **Duration-Based Bottlenecks:**
   - Machine95 (99 min), Machine53 (94 min), Machine58 (93 min), Machine96 (91 min)
   - These long-duration operations will significantly impact makespan

## Conflict Resolution Strategies:

1. **Sequential Scheduling for Shared Machines:**
   - Machine78: Schedule Job5‚ÜíJob6‚ÜíJob9‚ÜíJob10 in sequence
   - Machine91: Schedule Job2‚ÜíJob7‚ÜíJob11 in sequence
   - Machine82: Schedule Job3‚ÜíJob9‚ÜíJob10 in sequence

2. **Early Start for Long Operations:**
   - Prioritize jobs with high-duration operations (Job4-Step3: 94min, Job5-Step4: 99min)
   - Schedule bottleneck operations as early as possible

3. **Load Balancing:**
   - Distribute workload across time periods
   - Minimize machine idle time between operations

Supervisor Agent: Let me solve this JSSP problem step by step using a priority dispatching rule approach. I'll implement a solution that considers both job precedence and machine constraints.

**Supervisor Final Coordination:**

After analyzing the TA01 dataset with 15 jobs and 7 operations each, I'll apply a scheduling heuristic that prioritizes operations based on shortest processing time and earliest available machine time.

Job Scheduler Agent: Let me solve this JSSP problem step by step using a systematic approach. I'll use a priority dispatching rule to create an initial schedule.

**Job Scheduler Analysis: Detailed JSSP Solution for TA01 Dataset**

I'll solve this using the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) dispatching rule combined with job precedence constraints. Let me create a schedule by tracking machine availability and job progress.

**Analysis Process:**
1. Track each machine's availability timeline
2. Schedule operations respecting job precedence (sequential operations within jobs)
3. Assign operations to machines at earliest available time
4. Calculate makespan as the maximum completion time

Machine Coordinator Agent: Now let me provide a comprehensive machine coordination analysis and develop an optimized schedule:

**Machine Coordinator Analysis: [conflict resolution and optimization]**

## Critical Machine Conflicts Identified:

1. **High-Conflict Machines:**
   - **Machine10**: Used by Job1 (Steps 2,5) - potential self-conflict within job
   - **Machine18**: Used by Job2 (Steps 6,7) and Job7 (Step 1) - inter-job conflict
   - **Machine30**: Used by Job4 (Steps 2,6) and Job10 (Step 2) - inter-job conflict
   - **Machine78**: Used by Job5 (Step 1), Job6 (Step 5), Job9 (Step 5), Job10 (Step 5) - major bottleneck
   - **Machine82**: Used by Job3 (Step 6), Job9 (Step 4), Job10 (Step 7) - inter-job conflict
   - **Machine85**: Used by Job7 (Step 5) and Job9 (Steps 1,6) - inter-job conflict
   - **Machine91**: Used by Job2 (Step 5), Job7 (Step 3), Job11 (Step 3) - inter-job conflict

2. **Duration-Based Bottlenecks:**
   - Machine95 (99 min), Machine53 (94 min), Machine58 (93 min), Machine96 (91 min)
   - These long-duration operations will significantly impact makespan

## Conflict Resolution Strategies:

1. **Sequential Scheduling for Shared Machines:**
   - Machine78: Schedule Job5‚ÜíJob6‚ÜíJob9‚ÜíJob10 in sequence
   - Machine91: Schedule Job2‚ÜíJob7‚ÜíJob11 in sequence
   - Machine82: Schedule Job3‚ÜíJob9‚ÜíJob10 in sequence

2. **Early Start for Long Operations:**
   - Prioritize jobs with high-duration operations (Job4-Step3: 94min, Job5-Step4: 99min)
   - Schedule bottleneck operations as early as possible

3. **Load Balancing:**
   - Distribute workload across time periods
   - Minimize machine idle time between operations

## Optimized Schedule Solution:

Job Scheduler Agent: Let me solve this JSSP problem step by step using a systematic approach. I'll use a priority dispatching rule to create an initial schedule.

**Job Scheduler Analysis: Detailed JSSP Solution for TA01 Dataset**

I'll solve this using the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) dispatching rule combined with job precedence constraints. Let me create a schedule by tracking machine availability and job progress.

**Analysis Process:**
1. Track each machine's availability timeline
2. Schedule operations respecting job precedence (sequential operations within jobs)
3. Assign operations to machines at earliest available time
4. Calculate makespan as the maximum completion time

Machine Coordinator Agent: Now let me provide a comprehensive machine coordination analysis and develop an optimized schedule:

**Machine Coordinator Analysis: [conflict resolution and optimization]**

## Critical Machine Conflicts Identified:

1. **High-Conflict Machines:**
   - **Machine10**: Used by Job1 (Steps 2,5) - potential self-conflict within job
   - **Machine18**: Used by Job2 (Steps 6,7) and Job7 (Step 1) - inter-job conflict
   - **Machine30**: Used by Job4 (Steps 2,6) and Job10 (Step 2) - inter-job conflict
   - **Machine78**: Used by Job5 (Step 1), Job6 (Step 5), Job9 (Step 5), Job10 (Step 5) - major bottleneck
   - **Machine82**: Used by Job3 (Step 6), Job9 (Step 4), Job10 (Step 7) - inter-job conflict
   - **Machine85**: Used by Job7 (Step 5) and Job9 (Steps 1,6) - inter-job conflict
   - **Machine91**: Used by Job2 (Step 5), Job7 (Step 3), Job11 (Step 3) - inter-job conflict

2. **Duration-Based Bottlenecks:**
   - Machine95 (99 min), Machine53 (94 min), Machine58 (93 min), Machine96 (91 min)
   - These long-duration operations will significantly impact makespan

## Conflict Resolution Strategies:

1. **Sequential Scheduling for Shared Machines:**
   - Machine78: Schedule Job5‚ÜíJob6‚ÜíJob9‚ÜíJob10 in sequence
   - Machine91: Schedule Job2‚ÜíJob7‚ÜíJob11 in sequence
   - Machine82: Schedule Job3‚ÜíJob9‚ÜíJob10 in sequence

2. **Early Start for Long Operations:**
   - Prioritize jobs with high-duration operations (Job4-Step3: 94min, Job5-Step4: 99min)
   - Schedule bottleneck operations as early as possible

3. **Load Balancing:**
   - Distribute workload across time periods
   - Minimize machine idle time between operations

## Optimized Schedule Solution:
