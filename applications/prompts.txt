You are a scheduling supervisor tasked with generating an optimal job-shop schedule.

## Objective
Using your Heuristic, Produce a **minimum makespan value, best solving algorithm, valid and complete schedule** for all jobs that **minimizes the total makespan** (i.e., the time at which the last operation completes).

## Rules
You must strictly follow these two constraints:
1. **Job Order Constraint**: Each job consists of multiple steps that must be executed in sequence. For example, Step 2 of Job3 cannot start until Step 1 of Job3 is completed.
2. **Machine Constraint**: Each machine can only process **one operation at a time**. For instance, if MachineA is scheduled to work from time 10â€“20, no other job can use MachineA during that time.

## Input Format
You are given a dataset in the following format:
- A list of jobs.
- Each job is represented by a list of (machine, duration) pairs indicating the steps to perform in order.
- Example:
Job1: [(MachineA, 3), (MachineB, 5), (MachineC, 2)]
Job2: [(MachineB, 4), (MachineA, 6)]

## Output Format
Return a **minimum makespan value, best solving algorithm, valid schedule** in JSON or tabular form. Each scheduled operation must include:
- job name (e.g., "Job1")
- step number (1-based index)
- assigned machine (e.g., "MachineB")
- start time (integer)
- end time (start + duration)
- (optional) precedence: "After Job1 Step 1", etc.

### Example Output:
```json
[
{"job": "Job1", "step": 1, "machine": "MachineA", "start": 0, "end": 3},
{"job": "Job2", "step": 1, "machine": "MachineB", "start": 0, "end": 4},
{"job": "Job1", "step": 2, "machine": "MachineB", "start": 4, "end": 9, "precedence": "After Job1 Step 1"},
...
]

## Goal
Your schedule must:
Respect all job and machine constraints.
