Solving a Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) with 100 jobs and multiple operations per job is a complex task that involves finding an optimal sequence of operations on machines to minimize the makespan. Given the constraints and the size of the problem, a detailed solution requires computational tools and algorithms such as genetic algorithms, branch and bound, or constraint programming.

However, I can outline a general approach to solving this problem and provide a hypothetical solution format:

### Approach to Solve JSSP:

1. **Model the Problem:**
   - Define each job and its sequence of operations.
   - Identify machine constraints and ensure no two operations overlap on the same machine.

2. **Select an Algorithm:**
   - Use a heuristic or metaheuristic approach like Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, or Tabu Search.
   - Alternatively, use exact methods like Branch and Bound or Constraint Programming for smaller instances.

3. **Implement the Algorithm:**
   - Initialize a population of schedules (for heuristic methods).
   - Evaluate each schedule based on the makespan.
   - Apply crossover, mutation, or local search to improve schedules iteratively.

4. **Iterate and Optimize:**
   - Continue iterations until convergence or a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or time limit).

5. **Extract the Best Schedule:**
   - Identify the schedule with the minimum makespan from the final population.

### Hypothetical Solution Format:

Given the complexity and size of the problem, providing an exact solution without computational tools is not feasible here. However, I can illustrate how the solution format should look:

```plaintext
FINAL MAKESPAN: [Hypothetical Value]
STRUCTURED SCHEDULE:
- Job: Job1, Step: 1, Machine: Machine83, Start Time: 0, End Time: 59, Duration: 59
- Job: Job1, Step: 2, Machine: Machine49, Start Time: 59, End Time: 143, Duration: 84
- Job: Job1, Step: 3, Machine: Machine35, Start Time: 143, End Time: 211, Duration: 68
- Job: Job2, Step: 1, Machine: Machine11, Start Time: 0, End Time: 67, Duration: 67
- Job: Job2, Step: 2, Machine: Machine45, Start Time: 67, End Time: 153, Duration: 86
- Job: Job3, Step: 1, Machine: Machine34, Start Time: 0, End Time: 5, Duration: 5
- Job: Job3, Step: 2, Machine: Machine2, Start Time: 5, End Time: 77, Duration: 72
...
```

### Note:

- The start and end times are hypothetical and should be calculated using an appropriate scheduling algorithm.
- The makespan is the total time from the start of the first operation to the end of the last operation across all jobs.
- Ensure that each machine processes only one operation at a time and that operations within a job follow the specified sequence.

For an actual solution, implementing a scheduling algorithm in a programming environment like Python with libraries such as OR-Tools or using specialized scheduling software would be necessary.
