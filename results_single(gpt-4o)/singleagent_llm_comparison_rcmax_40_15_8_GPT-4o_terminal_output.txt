Solving a Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) with 40 jobs and 15 operations per job is a complex task that involves finding a schedule that minimizes the makespan while respecting job precedence and machine constraints. Given the complexity and size of the problem, a detailed solution requires computational tools and algorithms such as genetic algorithms, branch and bound, or constraint programming.

However, I can outline a general approach to solving this problem and provide a simplified example of how the output might look. The actual computation would typically be done using specialized software or a custom algorithm implementation.

### General Approach:

1. **Model the Problem:**
   - Define each job and its sequence of operations.
   - Define each machine and its availability.

2. **Constraints:**
   - Ensure operations within a job are performed in sequence.
   - Ensure no two operations overlap on the same machine.

3. **Objective:**
   - Minimize the makespan, which is the total time required to complete all jobs.

4. **Algorithm:**
   - Use a heuristic or exact algorithm to explore possible schedules.
   - Evaluate each schedule based on the makespan and constraints.

5. **Iterate:**
   - Adjust schedules iteratively to find improvements.

### Example Output Format:

Given the complexity, I'll provide a hypothetical example of how the output might look for a small subset of operations:

```
FINAL MAKESPAN: 5000
STRUCTURED SCHEDULE:
- Job: Job1, Step: 1, Machine: Machine5, Start Time: 0, End Time: 83, Duration: 83
- Job: Job1, Step: 2, Machine: Machine11, Start Time: 83, End Time: 211, Duration: 128
- Job: Job2, Step: 1, Machine: Machine9, Start Time: 0, End Time: 179, Duration: 179
- Job: Job2, Step: 2, Machine: Machine8, Start Time: 179, End Time: 359, Duration: 180
- Job: Job3, Step: 1, Machine: Machine5, Start Time: 83, End Time: 215, Duration: 132
- Job: Job3, Step: 2, Machine: Machine6, Start Time: 215, End Time: 303, Duration: 88
...
```

### Key Points:

- **Sequential Operations:** Each job's operations are scheduled sequentially.
- **Non-overlapping on Machines:** No two operations overlap on the same machine.
- **Makespan Calculation:** The makespan is determined by the latest end time of any operation.

### Conclusion:

To solve this problem accurately, you would typically use a computational tool or write a custom algorithm that can handle the complexity and constraints of the JSSP. The example above is a simplified illustration of how the output might be structured. For a real solution, you would need to implement or use an existing scheduling algorithm.

Job: Job2, Step: 1, Machine: Machine9, Start: 0, End: 179, Duration: 179
Job: Job2, Step: 2, Machine: Machine8, Start: 179, End: 359, Duration: 180
Job: Job3, Step: 1, Machine: Machine5, Start: 83, End: 215, Duration: 132
Job: Job3, Step: 2, Machine: Machine6, Start: 215, End: 303, Duration: 88
