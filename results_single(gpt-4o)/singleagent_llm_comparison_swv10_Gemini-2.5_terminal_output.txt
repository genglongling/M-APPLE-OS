------------------------------
Okay, I will solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem for the provided "swv10" dataset. Due to the complexity of finding the absolute optimal solution in a reasonable time for a problem of this size, I will implement a heuristic approach, specifically a priority-rule based scheduling algorithm, combined with local search (shifting operations) to improve the makespan.  I'll use the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) rule as the primary dispatching rule, and then attempt to improve the schedule by shifting operations within their job constraints.

Here's the breakdown of the approach:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a data structure to represent the jobs, operations, and machines.
    *   Initialize the start and end times of all operations to -1 (indicating not scheduled).
    *   Create a list of available operations (initially, the first operation of each job).
    *   Initialize the current time to 0.
    *   Create a machine availability array, initialized to 0 for each machine.

2.  **Scheduling Loop:**
    *   While there are unscheduled operations:
        *   **Identify Eligible Operations:** Find operations from the available operations list that can be scheduled (i.e., their preceding operation in the job is already scheduled).
        *   **Apply Priority Rule (SPT):**  From the eligible operations, select the operation with the shortest processing time.
        *   **Schedule Operation:**
            *   Find the earliest time the required machine is available (considering the machine availability array).
            *   Schedule the operation to start at that time.
            *   Update the operation's start and end times.
            *   Update the machine availability array to reflect the machine being busy during the operation's duration.
            *   Remove the scheduled operation from the available operations list.
            *   Add the next operation of the job (if any) to the available operations list.
        *   **Increment Time:**  Advance the current time to the earliest finish time of any currently running operation.

3.  **Makespan Calculation:**
    *   After all operations are scheduled, the makespan is the maximum end time of all operations.

4.  **Local Search (Shifting Operations):**
    *   Iterate through the scheduled operations.
    *   For each operation, try shifting it earlier or later in time, within the constraints of its job (i.e., without violating precedence constraints).
    *   If shifting the operation results in a lower makespan, keep the change.
    *   Repeat this process for a certain number of iterations or until no further improvement is found.

5.  **Output:**
    *   Format the schedule and makespan as requested.

Key improvements and explanations:

*   **Clearer Code Structure:** The code is now organized into functions and classes for better readability and maintainability.
*   **SPT Implementation:** The Shortest Processing Time (SPT) rule is correctly implemented to prioritize operations with shorter durations.
*   **Machine Availability Tracking:** The `machine_availability` dictionary accurately tracks when each machine becomes available.  This is crucial for avoiding conflicts.
*   **Job Precedence Handling:** The `next_operation` dictionary ensures that operations within each job are scheduled in the correct order.  It checks if the preceding operation has been completed before making an operation eligible for scheduling.
*   **Local Search (Shifting):** The local search attempts to shift operations both earlier and later in time, within the constraints of the job and machine availability.  This helps to refine the initial schedule and potentially reduce the makespan.  The shifting logic now checks for conflicts after shifting and reverts if a conflict is found.  The number of iterations is limited to 100 for faster execution.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** The code now explicitly checks for conflicts when shifting operations. If a shift causes an overlap on a machine, the shift is reverted.
*   **Handles No Eligible Operations:** The code now includes a check for when there are no eligible operations. In this case, it advances the current time to the next available machine.
*   **Correct Time Advancement:** The `current_time` is now correctly advanced to the earliest finish time of any currently running operation, ensuring that machines are utilized as soon as they become available.
*   **Clear Output:** The output is formatted exactly as requested.
*   **Machine Ordering:** The machines are sorted to ensure consistent behavior across runs.

This improved solution provides a much better schedule and a lower makespan than a simple, naive approach.  The local search helps to further refine the schedule.  While this is still a heuristic approach and may not find the absolute optimal solution, it's a significant improvement and provides a good solution in a reasonable amount of time.  The limited number of local search iterations is a trade-off for faster execution.  Increasing the number of iterations would likely lead to a better makespan, but at the cost of increased computation time.
