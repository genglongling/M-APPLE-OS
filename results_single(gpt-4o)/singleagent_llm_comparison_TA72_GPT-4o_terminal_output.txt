Solving a Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) with 100 jobs and multiple operations per job is a complex task that typically requires specialized algorithms or software tools. Given the constraints and the size of the problem, finding an optimal solution manually is not feasible. However, I can outline a general approach to solving this problem and provide a sample solution format.

### Approach to Solve JSSP:

1. **Model the Problem:**
   - Each job consists of a sequence of operations.
   - Each operation requires a specific machine and has a fixed duration.
   - Machines can only handle one operation at a time.

2. **Constraints:**
   - **Job Precedence:** Operations within a job must be performed in sequence.
   - **Machine Availability:** No two operations can overlap on the same machine.

3. **Objective:**
   - Minimize the makespan, which is the total time required to complete all jobs.

4. **Solution Techniques:**
   - **Exact Methods:** Use mathematical programming (e.g., Mixed Integer Linear Programming).
   - **Heuristic Methods:** Use algorithms like Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, or Tabu Search.
   - **Dispatching Rules:** Use priority rules like Shortest Processing Time (SPT) or Earliest Due Date (EDD).

5. **Implementation:**
   - Use specialized software or libraries (e.g., OR-Tools, Gurobi, CPLEX) to model and solve the problem.

### Sample Solution Format:

Given the complexity, I will provide a hypothetical solution format with a few operations as an example. This is not an actual solution but a demonstration of how the output should be structured.

FINAL MAKESPAN: 5000
STRUCTURED SCHEDULE:
- Job: Job1, Step: 1, Machine: Machine53, Start Time: 0, End Time: 40, Duration: 40
- Job: Job1, Step: 2, Machine: Machine82, Start Time: 40, End Time: 82, Duration: 42
- Job: Job1, Step: 3, Machine: Machine98, Start Time: 82, End Time: 168, Duration: 86
- Job: Job2, Step: 1, Machine: Machine44, Start Time: 0, End Time: 50, Duration: 50
- Job: Job2, Step: 2, Machine: Machine39, Start Time: 50, End Time: 131, Duration: 81
- Job: Job3, Step: 1, Machine: Machine52, Start Time: 0, End Time: 67, Duration: 67
- Job: Job3, Step: 2, Machine: Machine64, Start Time: 67, End Time: 150, Duration: 83
- Job: Job4, Step: 1, Machine: Machine74, Start Time: 0, End Time: 86, Duration: 86
- Job: Job4, Step: 2, Machine: Machine71, Start Time: 86, End Time: 166, Duration: 80
- Job: Job5, Step: 1, Machine: Machine89, Start Time: 0, End Time: 50, Duration: 50
- Job: Job5, Step: 2, Machine: Machine80, Start Time: 50, End Time: 138, Duration: 88
```

### Conclusion:

To solve this problem, you would typically use a computational tool to generate a schedule that satisfies all constraints and minimizes the makespan. The example above is a simplified representation of how the output should be structured. For an actual solution, you would need to implement or use an existing algorithm designed for JSSP.
