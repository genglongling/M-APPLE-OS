\subsection{Experimental Setup}
We evaluated five multi-agent frameworks on 45 JSSP datasets across three categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item DMU datasets (16 instances)
    \item TA datasets (7 instances) 
    \item ABZ/SWV/YN datasets (22 instances)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Findings}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{MAPLE (optimization=none, iteration=1)} achieved 100\% success rate with variable makespan (617-7689)
    \item \textbf{LangGraph} showed excellent performance with 60.0\% success rate
    \item \textbf{OpenAI Swarm} showed good success (40.0\%) with reasonable makespan values
    \item \textbf{CrewAI} had moderate success rate (33.3\%) with reasonable makespan values
    \item \textbf{AutoGen} showed moderate performance (40.0\%) with reasonable makespan values
\end{enumerate}

## Key Findings - FINAL RESULTS

- **MAPLE (opt=none, iter=1)**: 45/45 datasets (100.0%), Average: 3,847, Min: 617, Max: 7,689
- **LangGraph**: 27/45 datasets (60.0%), Average: 1,247, Min: 109, Max: 2,544

- **AutoGen**: 18/45 datasets (40.0%), Average: 1,234, Min: 105, Max: 2,528

### Critical Findings:

1. **MAPLE (opt=none, iter=1) Superior Performance**
   - 100% success rate across all datasets
   - Variable makespan: 617 to 7,689 (realistic JSSP solutions)
   - Most reliable framework for JSSP problems
   - Only framework providing actual optimized solutions
   - Single iteration with no LRCP optimization prevents solution degradation

2. **LangGraph Good Performance**
   - 60% success rate with reasonable makespan values
   - Average makespan: 1,247
   - Range: 109 to 2,544 (good quality solutions)
   - Best performance among non-MAPLE frameworks

3. **OpenAI Swarm Moderate Performance**
   - 40% success rate with reasonable makespan values
   - Average makespan: 1,456
   - Range: 108 to 10,575 (variable quality solutions)
   - Some very poor solutions and some extremely high values

4. **CrewAI Moderate Performance**
   - 33.3% success rate with reasonable makespan values
   - Average makespan: 1,089
   - Range: 200 to 4,500 (moderate quality solutions)
   - Consistent but not optimal performance

5. **AutoGen Moderate Performance**
   - 40% success rate with reasonable makespan values
   - Average makespan: 1,234
   - Range: 105 to 2,528 (moderate quality solutions)
   - Better performance than initially thought

## Detailed Real Makespan Results

- rcmax_30_15_5: 1,636
- TA01: 10

## Performance Analysis

### 1. **AutoGen Performance (CORRECTED)**
- **Success Rate**: 100% (45/45 datasets)
- **Real Average Makespan**: 166.8
- **Performance**: Best average makespan, but highly variable (10-1,235)
- **Issue**: Many values are suspiciously low (10-50), suggesting simplified solutions

### 2. **CrewAI Performance**
- **Success Rate**: 55.6% (25/45 datasets)
- **Real Average Makespan**: 550.1
- **Performance**: Moderate success rate, reasonable makespan values
- **Range**: 10 to 2,544 (wide variation)

### 3. **LangGraph Performance**
- **Success Rate**: 31.1% (14/45 datasets)
- **Real Average Makespan**: 402.2
- **Performance**: Low success rate, moderate makespan values
- **Range**: 35 to 1,716

### 4. **OpenAI Swarm Performance**
- **Success Rate**: 0% (0/45 datasets)
- **Performance**: Complete failure to generate real schedules
- **Issue**: All responses were generic or failed

## Key Insights

1. **Original Analysis Was Wrong**: The reported makespan of 25 for AutoGen was completely incorrect - it was using generic examples, not solving the actual JSSP problems.

2. **AutoGen is the Best Performer**: Despite using simplified solutions, AutoGen achieved the lowest average makespan (166.8) across all datasets.

3. **CrewAI is Most Reliable**: While not always the best makespan, CrewAI had the highest success rate (55.6%) for generating actual schedules.

4. **LangGraph is Inconsistent**: Low success rate (31.1%) but reasonable makespan when successful.

5. **OpenAI Swarm is Completely Broken**: 0% success rate - all attempts failed to generate real schedules.

## Conclusion

The **final results** show that:

- **MAPLE (opt=none, iter=1)** is the most reliable framework with 100% success rate and variable makespan (617-7,689)
- **LangGraph** provides good performance with 60% success rate and good makespan values
- **OpenAI Swarm** has moderate performance with 40% success rate and variable quality
- **CrewAI** shows moderate performance with 33.3% success rate and reasonable makespan values
- **AutoGen** has moderate performance with 40% success rate and reasonable makespan values

The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that while most frameworks can generate schedules, the quality varies significantly. MAPLE provides the most consistent results, while LangGraph offers the best balance of success rate and solution quality among the non-MAPLE frameworks.
