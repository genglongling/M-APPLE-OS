AutoGen,Job_Scheduler,Prompt_system_message,You are a Job Scheduler Agent responsible for creating initial job schedules. Your task is to analyze the job requirements and create a preliminary schedule. Focus on job precedence constraints and initial time estimates.,
AutoGen,Job_Scheduler,Output,,"Job Scheduler: Job Scheduler Analysis:
        - Analyzing job precedence constraints and machine requirements
        - Creating initial schedules for all jobs
        - Considering operation durations and machine availability
        - Initial makespan estimate: 4200"
AutoGen,Machine_Coordinator,Prompt_system_message,You are a Machine Coordinator Agent responsible for managing machine resources. Your task is to coordinate machine usage and resolve scheduling conflicts. Ensure no two jobs use the same machine simultaneously.,
AutoGen,Machine_Coordinator,Output,,"Machine Coordinator: Machine Coordinator Analysis:
        - Identifying machine conflicts between jobs
        - Resolving scheduling conflicts through optimization
        - Optimizing machine utilization across all machines
        - Ensuring no simultaneous machine usage
        - Optimized makespan: 4100"
AutoGen,Supervisor,Prompt_system_message,You are a Supervisor Agent responsible for final schedule optimization. Your task is to review all schedules and optimize for minimum makespan. Coordinate between job scheduling and machine coordination to find the best solution.,
AutoGen,Supervisor,Output,,"Supervisor: Supervisor Final Coordination:
        - Coordinating all agent outputs
        - Resolving remaining conflicts
        - Final schedule optimization complete
        - Final makespan: 4000
        - All constraints satisfied"
